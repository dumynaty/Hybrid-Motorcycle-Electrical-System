	Initial Concept

This project aims to convert a regular pedal bicycle into a hybrid vehicle by integrating an 80cc combustion engine and an electric motor, allowing it to switch between them automatically based on wheel RPM data from a sensor. This optimizes energy consumption and performance in various road conditions.

Initially, an 80cc engine was planned, but due to reliability issues, it was replaced with a more robust 125cc Lifan engine. This engine includes a magneto that supplies 12V for charging and powering other components. The throttle and clutch require strong cables, so more powerful motors were chosen to control them.
The electric motor chosen is a 350W, 9.47Nm unit, controlled by a dedicated driver and a throttle handle connected to an Arduino Mega (upgraded from Uno for more complex functionality). The vehicle uses sensors (RPM and gyroscope) for automatic motor switching and safety. If the rider falls, the gyroscope cuts off power to the motors.
A UPS module (with a 18650 battery) ensures the Arduino remains powered at all times. An ESP32 module sends real-time data via Bluetooth to a smartphone â€” including motor RPM, battery status, etc.
Charging the batteries is managed using voltage regulators, e-switch modules, and safety measures (to prevent reverse current). The system is a carefully engineered blend of electrical and mechanical integration.
