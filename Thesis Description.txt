This bachelor's thesis focuses on designing a hybrid system for a motorcycle, combining an electric motor with a combustion engine to enhance energy efficiency and reduce emissions. The project addresses the global shift toward sustainable transport by offering a transitional solution between conventional and fully electric vehicles.

Main Goal:
To build an integrated system that automatically switches between electric and thermal propulsion based on real-time usage, ensuring efficient energy use, safe operation, and smooth performance.

Key Steps:

Identify and classify main and secondary components (motors, battery, driver, etc.).
Design the system based on vehicle weight and power requirements.
Use simulations, software tools, and physical testing for validation.

Outcomes:
A working hybrid prototype for small vehicles.
Lower emissions, better energy performance.
Demonstrated integration feasibility of hybrid tech in motorcycles.

Limitations:
Testing was limited to controlled environments.
Real-world performance still to be evaluated.

Impact:

Environmental: Reduced carbon footprint and air pollution.
Economic: Lower user costs, potential for market expansion.
Scientific: Contributes to the knowledge base on compact hybrid systems.

Originality:
Innovative integration approach tailored for motorcycles, offering a valuable framework for future development in green mobility tech.
